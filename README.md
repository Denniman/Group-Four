IMPORTANT...

- Run npm install to download all packages and dependencies.

- Ensure your node_modules folder is included/not removed from the .gitignore.

- Always work from develop branch.

- You can access the pages assigned to you by adding the /pagename (e.g /signup) behind the localhost:port of your    app. However, the landing page can only be accessed by localhost:port/ (meaning it is the first page you'll come across when your development view is complete.).

- The components folder is for reuseable components such as the topbar which we will use in almost every page, the search handler and so on.

- All main pages should be at the root of the SRC folder ^_^

- Always pull before you push to avoid, merge conflicts. The repository can be updated at anytime.

- Dependencies such as eslint and prettier has been installed into the application to guide your writing process.

- ALWAYS PUSH TO DEVELOP AND NOT MASTER.


BONUS

- Type "npm run format" to format your css codes.

- Type "npm run lint" to format your jsx codes.



- Updates on notices will be shared here from time to time and on the whatsapp group.

Goodluck!
